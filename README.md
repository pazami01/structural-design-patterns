## Structural Design Patterns

In these exercises we will be examining the following design patterns, which have been categorised as "Structural":

1. Adapter 
2. Bridge
3. Composite 
4. Decorator 
5. Façade
6. Flyweight 
7. Proxy

1. We now consider the *Adapter* design pattern.

	A software developer, Maxim, has worked on an e-commerce website. 
The website allows users to shop and pay online. The site is integrated with a third party payment gateway, through which users can pay their bills using their credit card. 
Everything was going well, until his manager called him for a change in the project.

	The manager has told him that they are planning to change the payment gateway vendor, and Maxim has to implement that in the code. ]
	The problem that arises here is that the site is attached to the `Xpay` payment gateway which takes an `Xpay` type of object. 
The new vendor, `PayD`, only allows the `PayD` type of objects to allow the process. 
Maxim doesn't want to change the whole set of a hundred classes which have reference to an object of type `XPay`. 
He cannot change the third party tool provided by the payment gateway. 

	The problem arises due to the incompatible interfaces between the two different parts of the code. 
	To get the process to work, Maxim needs to find a way to make the code compatible with the vendor's provided API.

	The current code interface is not compatible with the new vendor's interface. 
	What Maxim needs here is an *Adapter* which can sit in between the code and the vendor's API, enabling the transaction to proceed (see the interface `IXpay`).

	The `Xpay` interface contains properties to maintain the information about the credit card and customer name. 
	The interface is implemented exposing the object to the vendor's API (`XpayImpl` on the repository).
	(The new vendor's interface is shown in `IPayD`.)
	
	As you can see, this interface has a set of different methods which need to be implemented in the code. 
	However, `Xpay` objects are created by most parts of the code, and it is difficult (and risky) to change the entire set of classes.
	We need some way to be able to fulfil the vendor's requirement to process the payment AND also make less (or no) changes to the current code base. 

	You are required to use the *Adapter* pattern to implement a `XpayToPayDAdapter` class to meet the requirements. 
	We can test your class to see whether it can solve the Maxim’s problem using the `RunAdapterExample` class from the repository.

2. This question concerns the *Bridge* design pattern.

	"Dodgy Security Systems" is a security and electronic company which produces and assembles products for cars. 
It delivers any car electronic or security system you want, from air bags to GPS tracking system, reverse parking system, etc. 
The company uses a well defined object oriented approach to keep track of their products using software which is developed and maintained only by them. 
They receive a vehicle, produce the system for it, and then assemble it and install it into the vehicle.

	Recently, they received new orders from "BigWheel" (a car company) to produce central locking and gear lock systems for their new car model. 
	To maintain this, they are creating a new software system. 
	They started by creating a new abstract class `CarProductSecurity`, in which they kept some car specific methods and some of the features which they thought are common to all security products. 
	Then they extended the class and created two different sub-classes:  	
	+ `BigWheelCentralLocking`, and 
	+ `BigWheelGearLocking`.
	
	The class diagram is as follows:
	
	![Design](images/design.png)
	
	After a while, another car company "Motoren" asked them to produce a new system of central locking and gear lock for their new model. 
	Since, the same security system cannot be used in both models of different cars, "Dodgy Security Systems" has produced a new system for them, and also has created two new classes:
	+ `MotorenCentralLocking`, and 
	+ `MotorenGearLocking`.
	
	They also extend the `CarProductSecurity` class. 
	Now the new class diagram looks like this:


	![NewDesign](images/newdesign.png)


	What happens if another car company demands another new system for central locking and gear lock? 
	One would need to create another two new classes for it. 
	This design will create one class per system, or worse, if a reverse parking system is produced for each of these two car companies, two more new classes will be created for each of them.
	
	Provide a solution to this problem using an implementation of the *Bridge* design pattern. 
	We provide an appropriate test class in `TestBridgePattern` from the repository which should produce the following output:
	
	```
	Producing Central Locking System
	Modifying product Central Locking System according to BigWheel xz model
	Assembling Central Locking System for BigWheel xz model
	Car: BigWheel xz model, Product:Central Locking System

	Producing Gear Locking System
	Modifying product Gear Locking System according to BigWheel xz model
	Assembling Gear Locking System for BigWheel xz model
	Car: BigWheel xz model, Product:Gear Locking System
	-----------------------------------------------------
	Producing Central Locking System
	Modifying product Central Locking System according to Motoren lm model
	Assembling Central Locking System for Motoren lm model
	Car: Motoren lm model, Product:Central Locking System

	Producing Gear Locking System
	Modifying product Gear Locking System according to Motoren lm model
	Assembling Gear Locking System for Motoren lm model
	Car: Motoren lm model, Product:Gear Locking System
	```
	
3. This question concerns the *Composite* design pattern.

	HTML is hierarchical in nature, its starts from an `<html>` tag which is the parent or the root tag, and it contains other tags which can be a parent or a child tag. 
The *Composite* design pattern in Java can be implemented using the component class as an abstract class or an interface. 
In this question, you will use an abstract class which contains all the important methods used in a composite class and a leaf class (see the `HtmlTag` abstract class).


	Given the `HtmlTag` abstract class complete two subclasses:
	+ `HtmlParentElement` — handles the *child* nodes, and
	+ `HtmlElement` — handles the *leaf* nodes.
	
	The `TestCompositePattern` class, from the repository, should be used to test out your classes.
	The code should produce the following output:
	
	```
	<html>
	<body>
	<p>Testing html tag library</p>
	<p>Paragraph 2</p>
	</body>
	</html>
	```
	
4. This question concerns the *Decorator* design pattern.

	You are commissioned by a pizza company make an extra topping calculator. 
	A user can ask to add extra topping to a pizza and our job is to add toppings and increase its price using our classes.

	**Please note**: the main aim of the *Decorator* design pattern is to attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. 
	Decorators provide a flexible alternative to sub-classing for extending functionality.
	The Decorator prevents the proliferation of subclasses leading to less complexity and confusion.

	For simplicity, let's create a simple `Pizza` interface which contains only two properties, `Description` and `Price`.
	The `Description` property is used to obtain the pizza's description whereas the 
	`Price` property is used to obtain the price.

	Provide two implementations of the `IPizza` interface:
	+ `SimplyVegPizza`
	+ `SimplyNonVegPizza`
	
	The decorator wraps the object whose functionality needs to be increased, 
	so it needs to implement the same interface. 
	
	Provide an abstract decorator class which will be extended by all the concrete decorators.

	Now provide several implementations of `PizzaDecorator` and test your classes with the given test class (`TestDecoratorPattern`).
	+ "Ham implements PizzaDecorator",
	+ "Cheese implements PizzaDecorator",
	+ "Chicken implements PizzaDecorator",
	+ "FetaCheese implements PizzaDecorator"
	+ ...

	The code should produce (something similar to) the following output:
	
	```
	Desc: SimplyVegPizza (230), Roma Tomatoes (5.20), Green Olives (5.47), Spinach (7.92)
	Price: 248.59
	Desc: SimplyNonVegPizza (350), Meat (14.25), Cheese (20.72), Cheese (20.72), Ham (18.12)
	Price: 423.81
	```
	
5. This question concerns the *Façade* design pattern.

	"BetterControl" is product based company and it has launched a product in the market, named "Schedule Server".
	It is a kind of server in itself, and it is used to manage jobs. 
	The jobs could be any kind of jobs like sending a list of emails, SMS, reading or writing files from a destination, or just simply transferring files from a source to the destination.

	The product is used by the developers to manage such types of job and enables them to concentrate on their business goals. 
	The server executes each job at their specified time and also manages any underling issues like concurrency, security, etc. 
	As a developer, one just needs to code the relevant business requirements and a good amount of API calls is provided to schedule a job according to their needs.
	
	Everything was going fine, until the clients started complaining about starting and stopping the server. 
	Although the server is working well, the initialisation and the shut down processes are very complex and they want an easy way to do that. 
	The server has exposed a complex interface to the clients which looks a bit *busy* to them.
	
	We need to provide an easy way to *start* and *stop* the server.

	A complex interface to the client is already considered as a fault in the design of the current system. 
	Fortunately or unfortunately, we cannot start the design and the coding from scratch. 
	We need a way to resolve this problem and make the interface easy to access.
	
	The problem faced by the clients in using the schedule server is the complexity brought by the server to start and stop its services. 
	The client wants a simple way to do it. 
	The following is the code that clients required to write to start and stop the server.
	
	```
	IScheduleServer scheduleServer = new ScheduleServer();	
	```
	To start the server, the client needs to create an object of the `IScheduleServer` class and then needs to call the following methods (in sequence) to start and initialise the server.
	
	```
	scheduleServer.StartBooting();
	scheduleServer.ReadSystemConfigFile();
	scheduleServer.Init();
	scheduleServer.InitializeContext();
	scheduleServer.InitializeListeners();
	scheduleServer.CreateSystemObjects();
	Console.WriteLine("Start working......");
	Console.WriteLine("After the work has been completed.........");	
	```
	To stop the server, the client needs to call the following methods in sequence:
	
	```
	scheduleServer.ReleaseProcesses();
	scheduleServer.Destory();
	scheduleServer.DestroySystemObjects();
	scheduleServer.DestoryListeners();
	scheduleServer.DestoryContext();
	scheduleServer.Shutdown();	
	```
	To resolve this, you will create a *Facade* class which will *wrap* a server object. 
	This class will provide simple interfaces (methods) for the client. 
	These interfaces internally will call the methods on the server object (see `ScheduleServerFacade`).
	
	The `TestFacade` class illustrates how the facade pattern makes a complex interface simple to use.
		
6. This question concerns the *Flyweight* design pattern.

	Sometimes the objects in an application might have great similarities and be of a similar kind (a similar kind here means that most of their properties have similar values and only a few of them vary in value). 
	In case they are also heavy objects to create, they should be controlled by the application developer. 
	Otherwise, they might consume much of the memory and eventually slow down the whole application.

	The Flyweight design pattern is designed to control such kind of object creation and provides you with a basic caching mechanism. 
	It allows you to create one object per type (the type here differs by a property of that object), and if you ask for an object with the same property (already created), it will return you the same object instead of creating a new one.

	The `X-Repl` site allows users to create and execute programs using their favourite programming language. 
	It provides you with plenty of programming language options. 
	You choose one, write a program with it and execute it to see the result.

	Now the site has started losing users, the reason being the slowness of the site.
	The site used to be very popular and sometimes there would be more than thousands of programmers using it; hence why the site is *crawling*. 
	The heavy usage is not the real problem behind the slowness of the site. 
	Let us examine the core programming of the site which allows users to run and execute their program, and the true issue will be revealed there (see the class `Code`).
	
	The `Code` class is used to set the code done by the programmer to get it executed. 
	The `Platform` interface is implemented by the language specific platform to execute the code. 
	It has one method which executes a `Code` object.	
	To execute the user code, a `Code` object which contains the code, and a `Platform` object to execute the 
	code, are created. 
	The typical code fragment looks like:

	```
	IPlatform platform = new JavaPlatform()
  	platform.execute(code)
	```
	The intent of the flyweight design pattern is to use shared objects to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently. 
	A flyweight is a shared object that can be used in multiple contexts simultaneously. 
	The flyweight acts as an independent object in each context — it’s indistinguishable from an instance of the object that’s not shared. 
	Flyweights cannot make assumptions about the context in which they operate.
	
	The key concept here is the distinction between *intrinsic* and *extrinsic* state. 	
	+ **Intrinsic state** is stored in the flyweight; it consists of information that’s independent of the flyweight’s context, thereby making it sharable.
	+ **Extrinsic state** depends on and varies with the flyweight’s context and therefore can’t be shared.
	
	Client objects are responsible for passing extrinsic state to the flyweight when it needs it.
	
	To solve this exercise, you will need to provide a "Platform" factory class which will control the creation of the `Platform` objects (see `PlatformFactory` from the repository).
	
	Your code should pass the (indicative) tests from `TestFlyweight` (on the repository).
	The code should produce the following output:

	```
	C Platform object created
	Compiling and executing C code.
	-------------------------------------
	Compiling and executing C code.
	-------------------------------------
	Java Platform object created
	Compiling and executing Java code.
	-------------------------------------
	Compiling and executing Java code.
	-------------------------------------
	Ruby Platform object created
	Compiling and executing Ruby code.
	-------------------------------------
	Compiling and executing Ruby code.
	```

7. This question concerns the *Proxy* design pattern which has several variations. 
   Some of the important variations are:   
   + Remote Proxy,
   + Virtual Proxy, and 
   + Protection Proxy.
   
   In this question, we will examine two of these variations.
   
	**a) Virtual Proxy**
	
	The *Virtual Proxy* design pattern is a memory saving technique that recommends postponing an object creation until it is needed; it is used when creating an object the is expensive in terms of memory usage or processing involved.

	Suppose there is a `Company` object in your application and this object contains a list of employees of the company in a `ContactList` object. 
	There could be thousands of employees in a company. 
	Loading the `Company` object from the database along with the list of all its employees in the `Contacts` object could be very time and resource consuming.
	In some cases you don’t even require the list of the employees, but you are forced to wait until the company and its list of employees loaded into the memory.
	
	One way to save time and memory is to avoid loading of the employee objects until required, and this is done using the *Virtual Proxy*. 
	This technique is also known as *Lazy Loading* where you are fetching the data only when it is required.
	The `Company` class has a reference to the `Contacts` interface whose real object will be loaded only when requested by a call of the appropriate method.
	The `Contacts` interface only contains one property, `Employees`, which is used to obtain the employee list of the company.
	
	The above class should create a real `Contacts` object which will return the list of employees for the company. 
	The object will be *loaded on demand*, only when required.
	
	The `ContactsProxyImpl` is the proxy class which also implements `IContacts` and holds a reference to the real `Contacts` object. 
	Through the implementation of the property `EmployeeList` it will check if the `ContactList` reference is `null`, then it will create a real `ContactList` object and access `EmployeeList` to obtain the list of the employees.
	(See the `Employee` class.)
	
	You should test your code with the `TestVirtualProxy` class from the repository.
	The code should produce (something similar to) the following output:
	
	```
	Company object created...
	Company Name: ABC Company
	Company Address: Alabama
	Company Contact No.: 011-2845-8965
	Requesting for contact list
	Creating contact list and fetching list of employees...
	Employee Name: Employee A, EmployeeDesignation: SE, Employee Salary: 2565.55
	Employee Name: Employee B, EmployeeDesignation: Manager, Employee Salary: 22574.0
	Employee Name: Employee C, EmployeeDesignation: SSE, Employee Salary: 3256.77
	Employee Name: Employee D, EmployeeDesignation: SSE, Employee Salary: 4875.54
	Employee Name: Employee E, EmployeeDesignation: SE, Employee Salary: 2847.01	
	```
	**b) Protection Proxy**
	
	In general, objects in an application interact with each other to implement the overall application functionality. 
	Most application object are generally accessible to all other objects in the application. 
	At times, it may be necessary to restrict the accessibility of an object only to a limited set of client objects based on their access rights. 
	When a client object tries to access such an object, the client is given access to the services provided by the object only if the client can furnish proper authentication credentials. 
	In such cases, a separate object can be designated with the responsibility of verifying the access privileges of different client objects when they access the actual object. 
	
	In other words, every client must successfully authenticate with this designated object to get access to the actual object functionality. 
	Such an object with which a client needs to authenticate to get access to the actual object can be referred as an *object authenticator* which is implemented using the *Protection Proxy* design pattern.

	We will return to the `ReportGenerator` application that you worked on earlier for the pizza company. 
	The owner now requires that only she can generate the daily report and that no other employee should be able to do so.
	
	To implement this security feature, you are going to use the *Protection Proxy* design pattern which will check if the object which is trying to generate the report is the owner; in this case, the report gets generated, otherwise it will not.
	The `Staff` interface is used by the `Owner` and the `Employee` classes and the interface has two methods: 
	+ `IsOwner()` returns a boolean to check whether the calling object is the owner or not.
	+ The other method is used to set the `ReportGeneratorProxy` which is a protection proxy, used to generate the report.
	
	The `Employee` class implements the `Staff` interface, since it’s an employee `IsOwner()` returns `false`. 
	The `GenerateDailyReport()` method asks `ReportGenerator` to generate the daily report.
	The `Owner` class looks almost the same as the `Employee` class; the only real difference is that `IsOwner`  returns `true`.
	
	The `ReportGeneratorProxy` acts as a *Protection Proxy*, and only has one method `GenerateDailyReport()` that is used to generate the report.
	See the `ReportGeneratorProtectionProxy` class which is the concrete implementation of `ReportGeneratorProxy` which holds a reference to the `ReportGenerator` interface which is the remote proxy. 
	In the `GenerateDailyReport` method, we check if the `staff` field is referring to the owner, then request the proxy to generate the report; otherwise it returns a string with `"Not Authorised to view report"` as the message.
	
	The `TestProtectionProxy` program should result in the following output:
	
	```
	For owner:
	********************Location X Daily Report********************
 	Location ID: 012
	Today's Date: Sun Sep 14 13:28:12 IST 2014
	Total Pizza Sell: 112
	Total Sale: $2534
	Net Profit: $1985
	***************************************************************
	For employee:
	Not Authorised to view report.	
	```
